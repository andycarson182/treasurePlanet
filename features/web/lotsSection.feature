  Scenario: The user login into the Fulfilld Web App
    Given I am on the login page
    When I login in fulfilld app

  # Scenario: Verify elements visibility for the lots section
  #   And I open the settings section
  #   And I search for "Lots" section

  #   And I check the page sub-header is "View and manage your warehouse lots."
  #   And I check the data table headers are displayed and are correct for lots

  # Scenario: Verify if user clicks the page back button is routed to the settings page.
  #   Given I am on the "lots" page
